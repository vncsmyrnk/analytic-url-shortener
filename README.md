# Analytic Url Shortener

Shorten URLs and view metrics. Inspired by [grabify](https://grabify.link).

## Desciption

The `api` and `client` directories contain Lua projects that represent the backend and frontend of the application, respectively. The Analytic URL Shortener allows users to create custom URLs that redirect to a specified website while tracking the time, IP address, and user agent of each request.

## Run locally

```sh
make run-api # Starts the api server
```

```sh
make run-client # Starts the client server. Accessible at http://localhost:8081
```

## Live environment

[Being implemented!](https://github.com/vncsmyrnk/analytic-url-shortener/issues) ðŸ”œ
